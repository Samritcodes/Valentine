            My Dearest Zena,
            There aren’t enough words in this world to capture what you mean to me, but if I were to try, I’d say you are beautiful, cute, pretty, exquisite, romantic, attractive, adorable, mesmerizing, captivating… and beyond all that, you are my everything. <br>         
            You are the snowfall—delicate, pure, breathtaking. You are a doll—precious, exquisite, one of a kind. But even those comparisons fall short because nothing in this universe could ever match the way you make me feel. <br>   
            I know I might not always do enough, might not always say the perfect things, but I am trying. Trying to be the man you deserve, trying to fill your heart with all the love you have poured into mine.<br>            
            I miss you in ways words fail to describe. I close my eyes, and I see you. I look at the sky, and I wonder if you’re looking at it too. I imagine a future where all these miles between us vanish, where I can finally hold you, where you’ll never have to wonder how deeply, how endlessly I love you—because you’ll feel it in every touch, in every look, in every moment. <br>          
            I promise you this: I will be by your side, through every storm, every sunrise, every dark and beautiful night. Because in this lifetime, in every lifetime, it will always be you.<br>
            I love you more than words can say, more than actions can show. You are my heart, my soul, my everything.<br>
From the very first moment I saw you typing my name in that gc, just by seeing you typing my name in the chat, something inside me shifted. I didn't even know a simple text could make my heart race, yet there I was, completely captivated. Your words, your presence- just the thought of you made everything around me seem so much smaller, so much less significant. I had no idea that someone's name on my screen would soon become the most important thing in my life<br>
Do you remember those first conversations? How we talked like: "Hawt", "You", and continued our talk which is a bit like romantic from the start, using those quoted phrases in between our words, straight out of a book typa convo, and how you made me feel something I hadn't felt before? It wasn’t just attraction- it was something deeper, something that felt like home<br>
You were sharp, witty, and so effortlessly enchanting. And I? I was just a boy falling faster than he could admit.<br>
And then came the day you sent me your picture i couldn't be more happy and mesmerizing by looking you, gazing you i was just getting out of my mind again and again, just couldn't stop dreaming all the time, every second
that Sunkissed selfie, and i was like " The sun fades into the night, its light disappearing with the day. But you? Even though we’re apart, I'm pretty sure that your beauty will never fade. You keep shining in my life, no matter the distance. The sun might need to rest, but your glow? It’s constant, always there, brighter than any star.
But honestly, it feels so dumb to even compare you to things like this. You completely outshine all of them. Silly me for trying.<br>
(You know, you've actually increased the value of my phone, just by being in it. I mean, every message, your pics 🤭. it’s like this little device holds something priceless now. It’s funny how something so simple means so much more, just because you're there. 😭) "
I think about the times we’ve exchanged words, how you’ve shaped me without even realizing. The days when I asked you for words to write songs for you, and how you effortlessly gave me inspiration without even trying. Every lyric, every note—it belongs to you. Just like every piece of me does.
And how could I ever forget the days I missed you the most? Those five days you were offline. I knew you needed a break, I knew you would come back, but that didn’t stop the ache. I was restless, texting like a fool, knowing you wouldn’t see them, knowing it didn’t matter, yet I couldn’t stop myself. Because I missed you beyond reason, beyond anything I could explain. Those days taught me just how deep this runs—how my world feels incomplete when you’re not in it.<br>
Every anniversary, every moment, every memory—we are building something beautiful, something that even distance cannot weaken. And I know, I know, one day, I will be standing in front of you. No more screens, no more texts—just you and me, as real as we’ve always been. And when that day comes, Zena, I will look at you the way I always have—like you are the most precious thing in this world.<br>
And then, there were the days you told me about yourself, the moments when you let me in just a little more. I held on to every word, memorized every detail, because each one was a piece of you. The moments when you shared about your struggles, about the things that have shaped you—the strength you carry, the fire inside you, the soft yet unbreakable heart. I wanted nothing more than to wrap you in my arms and tell you that no matter what, I would always be here.<br>

and the day you've told me about your measurements woahhhh- 30, 36, 38, 45, um uhm<br>

And then came the day you sent me those pictures, flood of them. God, Zena. I don’t think you understand what you did to me. I wasn’t prepared for that level of beauty, that kind of breathtaking perfection. i stared, i revisited them over and over, because you, You looked so unbelievably beautiful, cherishing and so cuuuteee. I couldn't believe that someone like you existed, let alone that you were mine. I saved every picture in my heart, not just on my phone. Because every time I look at them, I don’t just see your face—I see everything you mean to me.<br>

There were days when we laughed, days when we teased each other like kids, and days when we talked about things so deep it felt like the universe had paused just to listen. I remember the nights when you were feeling low, and I wanted nothing more than to pull you into my arms, like back in those days. to tell you that no matter how heavy your burdens felt, I’d carry them with you. You are strong, yet so soft. Hard, yet gentle. You are a paradox in the most beautiful way, and I love every single part of it.<br>

and days we discussing about us being parents<br>

I know there have been moments when I felt like I wasn't doing enough, even today hahh the worst thing i've done ya i've gave you pain, like I wasn't showing you just how much you mean to me. But if I could carve my feelings into the stars, I would. If I could gather every word that describes you—beautiful, adorable, mesmerizing, captivating, breathtaking, enchanting—I’d still fall short, because no words could ever be enough. You are beyond language, beyond expression.<br>
I can't be more happy, overjoyed, elated, ecstatic, euphoric, delighted, thrilled, enchanted, captivated, mesmerized, and beyond grateful to have found you—glad, grateful, lucky, blessed, enchanted, mesmerized, overwhelmed, cherished, treasured, honored, fulfilled, complete. Every moment with you feels like a gift, a dream woven into reality, a love story I never thought I’d get to live. You are my serendipity, my fate, my heart’s deepest wish come true.I can't be more happy, overjoyed, elated, ecstatic, euphoric, delighted, thrilled, enchanted, captivated, mesmerized, and beyond grateful to have found you—glad, grateful, lucky, blessed, enchanted, mesmerized, overwhelmed, cherished, treasured, honored, fulfilled, complete.

One day, I will hold you in my arms. One day, I will look into your eyes without a screen between us. Until then, I promise to love you with everything I have, to cherish you in every moment, to remind you every single day that you are my world.<br>

<br>Happy Valentine’s Day, my love.
<br>Forever and always,
<br>Yours and only yours,
